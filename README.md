# Laravel CRUD

I have created a project using laravel 10.7.1, which is used to perform Create,Read, Upadate & Delete 

It contains 2 modules, one for GUI and another is WEB-API:

GUI: 
    
    This Module can be accessed using http://url/crud (e.g: http://127.0.0.1:8000/crud)
    
    which shows list of all users and we can add or update users from this module.

API: 
    
    This Module can be accessed using http://urlapi//crudapi (e.g: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/crudapi)
    
    which returns list of all employees and we can add or update users from this API 
    It accepts GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods
